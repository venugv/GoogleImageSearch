  * [x] User can scroll down “infinitely” to continue loading more image results

####Points to Note:
  * [x] Google’s image search API has been deprecated and hence this app can’t be used to perform more than 100 searches
  * [x] Need to rewrite this app to use the Flickr search API for a more robust experience
